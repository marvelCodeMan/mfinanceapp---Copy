 -------Description-------
 This app focuses on the problem of searching a good microfinancing firm that suits one's requirements. In rural setting, due to lack of information and technological
 access, rural public is, by far and large, unable to acheive the same. 
 Many become victims of accessive interest rates and dept traps
 
 Our aims recommend the best microfinancing firms based on one's requirement which is done by a recommendation engine which is trained on parameteres such as minimum and maxi-
 mum nominal interest rates, loan, loan term etc.
 
 User will have to enter the loan amount and interest rate which they think they can repay and the engine will recommend the best possible microfinancing firm
 
 -----How to run-------
 
 You have to run the command npx create-react-app
 Then you will have to replace the following downloaded folders with the folders in repo
      App.js
      components folder
 Then you have to run the command npm start
 
 The web app is not yet embedded with a backend service but our project is emulating the working of the embedded one. We will make it database powered in the future.
 
 On pressing the submit button, a csv file will be downloaded in your system. This file (Report (x).csv) along with 'generate.csv' needs to be uploaded to the colab code
 which will serve as the data for the ai model.
